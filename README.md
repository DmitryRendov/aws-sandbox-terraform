# Terraform #

## Setup
```bash
make setup
```

## Running

We use `make` to wrap Terraform commands and include extra functionality.

#### Example commands
```
make plan                                         #default workspace
make plan-prod                                    #prod workspace
make plan-prod TERRAFORM_EXEC_ROLE=dmitry_rendov  #prod workspace using the joe johnson role
make apply-prod ARGS='-target=module.default'     #apply in prod and target one module
```

#### Example set role before commands
```bash
aws-bastion.sh login
export TERRAFORM_EXEC_ROLE=dmitry_rendov
make plan-prod
make apply-prod
```

## Layout ##

### mob
This is where the MOB applications live.

### audit|bastion|production ###
Configuration for each respective account, there is only one account per directory

### <account>/global
Configuration for resources which are global in AWS, shared across multiple roles and required for each new account.

Examples:

* Global IAM role
* ACM Certificates
* Cloudtrail and AWS Config Setup

### <account>/roles
A role is a distinct functionality which requires typically requires it's own separate IAM role.

Examples:
* website
* server
* ecs

### **global-variables.tf.json ###
Shared variables across all Terraform code

### **account-variables.tf.json ###
Shared variables across an account

### **tf** and **terraform.sh** ###

Terraform wrapper scripts (symlinked).

### **lib/** ###

Shared Makefiles, scripts, plugins, providers, configurations


## Modules ##

Modules are in `/modules`, roughly divided into two categories: `base` and `site`

`base` modules are modules that are used by other modules, or modules that are copied from the Internet. These are modules that we could conceivably release as open source.
`site` modules are modules that have MOB specific configuration, and are unlikely to be ever released to the public. They very likely are a composition of other modules.

### Module versioniong ###

Each module has one or more versions. When creating a new version, simply copy the code to the next version directory, and make a PR with changes. It is best to make one commit to add the new version with no code changes, and subsequent commits to make changes, so it is easier for code reviewers to see just the differences in a module.

Breaking changes that require a new version:

* New required variables
* Changes to default behavior that require the caller to make changes to the way they use the module, the resources it creates, or their understanding of the universe.

Non-breaking changes that do not require a new version:

* Adding outputs (usually)
* Use your best judgement
